        <h2>Rationale and Limitations</h2>
        <h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Rationale: I have seen maps about Indo-European languages, but they’re usually about showing where various languages or language families were spoken. They don’t really discuss vocabulary or sound changes. So, I decided to make some maps showing how words descended from Proto Indo-European developed in various locations. </li>

            <br><br>

            <li>Limitation 1: The geographic markers are approximate. For instance, while we know the peoples who spoke Tocharian lived in Western China, we’re not sure who they were much less where they came from. </li>

            <br><br>

            <li>Limitation 2: I tried to find words from all the Indo-European subfamilies, but could not manage it always. This could be because we don’t have evidence of that word in those languages, or I couldn’t find it in my research.  </li>

            <br><br>

            <li>Limitation 3: Making these maps without any explanation doesn’t really accomplish much. They need to be contextualized, thus this website. </li>

            <br><br>

            <li>Limitation 4: How much information to include? It would be easy to include so much information that I would overwhelm people. As a result, I decided to include links, so that people can look up more information if they’re interested. </li>

            <br><br>

            <h2>Some Terminology</h2>

            <ul><h3>

                <li>Inscriptions/glosses  -- Inscriptions are writings left in the language, Glosses are lists of words in two languages. These are two of the primary ways we decipher and classify languages. Place names also play a role. Inscriptions can be very short or entire works of literature. Many are very short, things like “Here lies so-and-so, child of someone else”.

                    Take Thracian as an example. It left behind six inscriptions that we know of. There isn’t a lot of information to be gleaned from those, especially since one or two of them are on rings, so they are very short. We also have glosses, primarily in Greek or Latin, and place names. Sill, that isn’t a lot of information.
                    </li>

                <br><br>

                <li>Laws of Sound Change— While studying related languages, linguists discovered patterns, and described them. These are laws of sound change. Examples include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm%27s_law">Grimm’s Law</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centum_and_satem_languages">Centum/Satem</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruki_sound_law">RUKI rule.</a> </li>

                <br><br>

                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_theory">Laryngeals</a> – Many of the proposed sound changes from Proto Indo-European to its daughter languages can be traced by comparing the same word in different languages, and then figuring out what the base word would be. However, when trying to establish how some vowel changes work, this strategy didn’t work. 

                    So, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_de_Saussure">Ferdinand de Saussure</a> proposed that a few sounds existed in Proto Indo-European that did not appear in any of its daughter languages. At first, this theory was rejected by many because many didn’t think that positing sounds that aren’t in the record was inappropriate.
                    
                    Then, Hittite was deciphered. Hittite has laryngeals, proving de Saussure’s theory. It is now thought that there were three laryngeals, normally marked H1, H2, and H3 or H, H1, and H2.
                    </li>

                <br><br>

                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_case">Case</a> – Case is a system of adding suffixes to some parts of speech, depending on the role they play in a sentence. German has four cases: nominative (the subject of the sentence), accusative (the direct object and the object of some prepositions), dative (the indirect object and the object of other prepositions) and genitive (stands for “of” or “from”). 
                    	
                        This can matter for language change. Take Latin and its daughter languages. The Latin word for “Father” is “pater” in the nominative form. However, the Romance languages derive their words for “father” from the accusative form: “patrem”. This is because the accusative form was more common than the other cases.

        <h2>The Indo-European Language Families</h2>

        <ol><h3>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_language">Albanian</a> – Albanian sits on its own branch of the Indo-European language family. Some linguists have tried to connect it to Illyrian, or Thracian, but the evidence isn’t that strong. 
                Albanian is spoken in Albania and Kosovo, but also in other nations in the Balkans and Southern Europe. As a written language, the first documents appear in the mid-15th century, which makes it the latest attested of the major Indo-European languages.
                </li>

                <br><br>

            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_language">Armenian</a> - sits on its own branch of the Indo-European language family. It is spoken primarily in Armenia, but, due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_diaspora">the Armenian Diaspora</a>, many countries have a population of Armenian speakers. 
                Armenian has its own alphabet dating from the 5th century. A Bible written in the 5th century is the oldest surviving text in Armenian.
                </li>

                <br><br>
            
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolian_languages">Anatolian</a> – This branch of the Indo-European family is extinct. These languages were spoken mostly in Asia Minor (now Turkey). The best documented of these languages is Hittite, which is the oldest documented Indo-European language and includes features not found in other Indo-European languages, like laryngeals. Hittite words have been found in Assyrian manuscripts dating to the 17th century BCE. Hittite went extinct when the Hittite Empire fell during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse">Bronze Age Collapse</a>. 

                </li>

                <br><br>

            <li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balto-Slavic_languages">Balto-Slavic</a> – Balto-Slavic language family is subdivided into the Baltic and Slavic languages.
                
                <br><br>
                <ol>
                <li>The Baltic languages were spoken around the Baltic Sea and in Northern Europe. Old Prussian is the first attested Baltic language, first appearing in the 13th century. It was extinct by the 18th century. Lithuanian has a complicated case system, preserving many of the cases proposed for Proto-Indo-European.</li>
                
                <br><br>

                <li>The Slavic Languages are spoken in Central and Eastern Europe and into Asia, across Central Asia and Siberia. The oldest attested Slavic Language is Old Church Slavonic, from about the 9th or 10th century. It is a liturgical language, so many of its texts are religious in nature. 
                The Slavic languages have three subfamilies: East Slavic, which includes Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian; West Slavic, which includes Polish, Czech, and Slovak, and South Slavic, which includes Old Church Slavonic, Bulgarian, and Serbian.</li>
                </ol></li>

                <br><br>

            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_languages">Celtic</a> – The Celtic languages were spoken across Central and Western Europe, and even into Asia Minor, but now, they are limited to the British Isles and Brittany in France.  The two best attested languages are Irish and Welsh, but Gaulish, Celtiberian, and Lepontic also left inscriptions behind, The modern Celtic languages are divided into two groups: Brittonic (Welsh, Cornish, and Breton) and Goidelic (Irish, Scots Gaelic and Manx). They are sometimes referred to as p-Celtic, because, in the Brittonic languages, the /k<sup>w</sup>/ changed to a /p/ or /b/ sound, and q-Celtic, because the Goidelic languages maintained the /k<sup>w</sup>/ sound. 
                Some linguists group Celtic and Italic into one subfamily called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italo-Celtic">Italo-Celtic</a>. Irish developed an alphabet, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogham">Ogham</a>, which was used from the 4th to 9th centuries.</li>

            <br><br>

            <li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages">Germanic</a> – The Germanic languages include the Scandinavian languages (except Finnish), German, Dutch, and English, among others. Gothic is well documented because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Argenteus">the Codex Argenteus</a>, a Bible written in Gothic in the 6th century.
                The Germanic languages have been studied for a long time, and, among the sound changes that occurred in them is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm%27s_law">Grimm’s Law</a>, which discussed the changes in stop consonants over time in the Germanic languages.  This was the first time, sound changes across languages and time had been described systematically. Grimm’s law led to the creation of Historical Phonology as a field of Historical Linguistics. 
                And, yes, Jacob Grimm, the linguist who codified Grimm’s law is one of the Brothers Grimm of Fairy Tale fame. 
                </li>

                <br><br>

            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language">Greek</a> – Greek is now spoken in Greece and Cyprus as an official languages and as a minority language in other countries. When we discuss Ancient Greek, we can be referring to several different languages spread over a long periods of time. This includes Mycenean Greek, spoken during the Bronze Age, Classical Greek, and the various dialects of the Greek city-states. 
                Greek developed writing more than once: Mycenean Greek developed a syllabary that we call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_B">Linear B</a> , which is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_A">Linear A</a>, a still undeciphered language. Linear B died out in the 12th century BCE, during the Bronze Age collapse. The Greek dialect on Cyprus used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_syllabary">the Cypriot Syllabary</a>, also based on Linear A. A few hundred years after the Bronze Age collapse. Greek developed a new alphabet, the one we’re familiar with, this one based on the Phoenician. 
                </li>

                <br><br>

            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Iranian_languages">Indo-Iranian</a> - These languages are spoken in India, Iran, and Central Asia. 
                <br><br>
                <ol>
                <li>Sanskrit, an Indian language, is one of the best known ancient Indo-European languages. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigveda">The Rig Veda</a>, written in Vedic Sanskrit, is a hymnal written between 1500 BCE and 1000 BCE. Because Sanskrit has left so many documents behind, it is important in Indo-European studies.</li> 
                
                <br><br>

                <li>Two languages on the Iranian branch, Avestan and Old Persian are also well-attested.  Farsi, the language of Iran and much of Central Asia, is descended from Old Persian. These languages are also important in Indo-European studies. </li>
               </ol> </li>

               <br><br>

            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italic_languages">Italic</a> – These are the languages that were spoken on the Italian peninsula. Latin and its daughter languages are the best known of these languages, but the family also includes extinct languages like Oscan and Umbrian. Outside of Latin, most of the other Italic languages are not well-attested. Because we have so much surviving documentation in Latin, we can trace sound changes through the Romance languages. Some linguists group Celtic and Italic into one subfamily called Italo-Celtic.</li>

            <br><br>

            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tocharian_languages">Tocharian</a> – The Tocharian languages were discovered in documents in monasteries in western China in the 20th century. They are the easternmost members of the Indo-European language family. Linguists have deciphered two Tocharian languages, Tocharian A and Tocharian B. The documents mostly date from the 6th to the 8th centuries CE. Linguists are not entirely certain who spoke Tocharian. The name “Tocharian” comes from the Greek “Tocharoi”, which referred to the Yuezhi people. Evidence now shows that that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuezhi">the Yuezhi</a> spoke an Indo-Iranian language, but the name stuck.</li>

               <br><br>

            <li>Unclassified – Some languages, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illyrian_language">Illyrian</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thracian_language">Thracian</a>, have left enough vocabulary behind that we know they’re Indo-European languages, but we don’t know much else. Are they on an already established branch of the Indo-European language family, like Celtic or Balto-Slavic or are they on their own branches? Take Illyrian for example. Illyrian was spoken in the Balkans, primarily in what is now Albania, Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia, North Macedonia, and Kosovo. The Illyrian people didn’t develop a written language, so the only remnants of it are glosses in other languages, such as Ancient Greek and Latin, and place names. So, we don’t have a lot of information here. Some linguists have analyzed what we do have, and try to link Illyrian with Albanian, but this link can’t really be proven.</li>
